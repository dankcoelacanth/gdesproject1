        <h1 id="minititle"> Vampire Lord </h1>
        <h2> Originally the Vampire Lord was kind of a speedpaint for my Dungeons and Dragons campaign, but my idea was to give him silver skin like the silver tears from Elden Ring. Overall I'm happy with how it turned out - especially for the timeframe it was churned out in. I think the blue in the 'hair' was a good addition and makes it feel a bit more silvery. I am THRILLED with how the base turned out, the original base was just him standing on a rock, but I added some broken up cork board, a lot of skulls, and a lot of various shades of blue and white paint to make it look like he's standing on this giant icicle in a frozen hell.
